# Week 10 Lab report 5

## How you found the tests with different results (Did you use diff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)
- I used diff
- Then selected which diffrence to use

### Test 1
#### Ouput of given program
```

[foo(and(bar))]

```

#### Output of my program

```

[foo(and(bar))]

```

#### Expected Output

```

[foo(and(bar))]

```

## Describe which implementation is correct, or if you think neither is correct, by showing both actual outputs and indicating what the expected output is.
- Since both outputs match the expected output, generated by commonmark.org, both are correct.
