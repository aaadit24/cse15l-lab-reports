# Week 10 Lab report 5

## How you found the tests with different results (Did you use diff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)
- I used diff
- Then selected which diffrence to use

## Test 1: Test file 495
#### Ouput of provided implementation
```

[foo(and(bar))]

```

#### Output of my program

```

[foo(and(bar]

```

#### Expected Output

```

[foo(and(bar))]

```


#### Describe which implementation is correct, or if you think neither is correct, by showing both actual outputs and indicating what the expected output is.
- The provided implementation is correct as it matches the expected output, generated by commonmark.org. My output is incorrect. the following line needs to be corrected 

```

closeParen = markdown.indexOf(")", openParen);

```

- My code doesn't properly match the parenthesis/brackets. It matches the first open with the first closed one and does not stack additional brackets.
- To fix my code I will add a stack program, to find the matching brackets/parenthesis.

## Test 1: Test file 12
#### Ouput of provided implementation
```

[]

```

#### Output of my program

```

[\]

```

#### Expected Output

```

[]

```

#### Describe which implementation is correct, or if you think neither is correct, by showing both actual outputs and indicating what the expected output is.
- The provided implementation is correct as it matches the expected output, generated by commonmark.org. My output is incorrect. the following line needs to be corrected 
```

int = openParen = link.indexOf("(");
if(link.subsstring(openParen, link.length() -1).contains(" "){
  link = link.substring(0,link.indexOf(" ", openParen));
}
int closeParen = link.lastIndexOf(")");

```
- My code doesn't check if the parenthesis("()"), come after the brackets("[]").
- To fix my code I will look for the parenthesis after the close brackets("]").
